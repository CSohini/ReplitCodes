# This program will check the change in an account balance. Write a function that accepts a start_price and an end_price and returns the percent change using the relationship. Round the final result to the nearest whole number. Print a statement above the return that says: 'The percent change in the account balance is:'

# ((end_price-start_price)/start_price)*100

# start_price and end_price are the parameters ("variables", "placeholder")

# YOUR CODE

def percent_change(start_price, end_price):
  percent_change = round(((end_price-start_price)/start_price)*100)
  print ("The percent change in the account balance is:")
  return percent_change
  







# Tests
x=1000
y=1200
print(percent_change(x,y))
# EXPECTED OUTPUT
# The percent change in the account balance is:
# 20

a=1200
b=950
print(percent_change(a,b))
# EXPECTED OUTPUT
# The percent change in the account balance is:
# -21
