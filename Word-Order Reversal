# Write a  function called word_reverse() that asks the user for a long string containing multiple words. Print back to the user the same string, except with the words in backwards order. For example, say I type the string:

#   My name is Michele
# Then I would see the string:

#   Michele is name My
# shown back to me.

# Hint: Take a look at the "insert method" https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_list_insert.asp

def word_reverse(word):
  x=word.split()
  y=[]
  for i in x:
    y.insert(0,i)
  return ' '.join(y)

a='My name is Michele'
print (word_reverse(a)) #Michele is name My
