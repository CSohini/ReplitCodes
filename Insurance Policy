#Suppose your apartment was burglarized.  The insurance guy calls to discuss your policy, which is limited to cover a particular maximum in losses (for example, $50,000). You calculate the bill for the difference you lost.

# Given an dictionary of the stolen items and a limit, return the difference between the total value of those items and the limit of the policy. Name the function calc_diff().

# Your Code
def calc_diff(d, lim):
  s=sum(d.values())
  diff = s-lim
  print (diff)




# Run the function
# Test 1
d1={"skate": 10, "painting": 20, "computer": 899 }
lim1=900
calc_diff(d1, lim1) # 29

# Test 2
d2={"skate": 10, "painting": 20 }
lim2=19
calc_diff(d2,lim2) # 11

# Test 3
d3={"skate": 200, "painting": 200, "shoes": 1 }
lim3=350
calc_diff(d3,lim3) # 51

# Notes
# The dictionary data always contains at least an item (no empty objects).
# The sum of the items is always greater than the limit.
