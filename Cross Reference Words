# Create a function that takes an initial word and extracts any words that start with the same letters as the initial word. Return a list of matching words. 

# Hint: Look at the startswith() method - https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_startswith.asp

# YOUR CODE
def cross_ref(ini_word, list):
  match_words = []
  for word in list:
    if word.startswith(ini_word):
      match_words.append(word)
  return match_words





# # Tests (uncomment to run)
cr1=cross_ref("bu", ["button", "breakfast", "border"]) # ["button"]
print(cr1)

cr2=cross_ref("tri", ["triplet", "tries", "trip", "piano", "tree"]) # ["triplet", "tries", trip"]
print(cr2)

cr3=cross_ref("beau", ["pastry", "delicious", "name", "boring"]) # []
print(cr3)

# Notes
# If none of the words match, return an empty list.
# Keep the filtered list in the same relative order as the original list of words.
