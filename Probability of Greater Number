# Given a list of numbers and a value n, write a function that returns the probability of choosing a number greater than or equal to n from the list. The probability should be expressed as a percentage, rounded to one decimal place.

# Notes
# Precent probability of event = 100 * (num of favorable outcomes) / (total num of possible outcomes) 

# For example if we have a collection of values [1,8,3,4,19,40] and a number 17, the probability that a randomly selected number in the list is greater than 17 is 2/6 or 33.33%. There are 2 values greater than 17 in the list and 6 total values.


def probability(list, n):
  count=0
  for i in list:
    if i>=n:
      count+=1
  prob= 100*count/len(list)
  return round(prob,1)
  





# Examples
p1=probability([5, 1, 8, 9], 6) # ➞ 50.0
print(p1)

p2=probability([7, 4, 17, 14, 12, 3], 16) # ➞ 16.7
print(p2)

p3=probability([4, 6, 2, 9, 15, 18, 8, 2, 10, 8], 6) # ➞ 70.0
print(p3)
